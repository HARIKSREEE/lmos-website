# What is an Agent?

In the context of LMOS an **agent** is a specialized software program that **uses the capabilities of a machine learning model** to perform specific tasks. For example, an agent can process user input in natural language using an LLM to understand it, then interact with various tools, APIs, or data sources to perform tasks or deliver accurate responses.

Some examples:

* A weather agent can understand a natural language request like "Whatâ€™s the weather today?" and fetch the relevant information from a weather service API.
* A sales agent might respond to inquiries about product availability by consulting inventory databases.


But agents can also use other models in addition to Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs are great for understanding and generating natural language, agents can also integrate other types of AI models and tools depending on the task. 

For example:

* **Computer Vision Models:** Agents can use models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers for tasks involving image recognition or object detection. For instance, an agent might analyze images from a camera to detect objects or people.

* **Speech Recognition Models:** Agents can integrate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models to convert spoken language into text. This is useful for voice assistants that need to understand spoken commands.

* **Reinforcement Learning Models:** In scenarios requiring decision-making and learning over time (like games or robotics), agents might use Reinforcement Learning models to make better decisions based on feedback from their environment.

* **Time-Series Models:** For tasks like forecasting (e.g., predicting stock prices or weather conditions), agents might use statistical models or deep learning models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) for processing time-series data.

* **Recommendation Systems:** Agents handling recommendations (like suggesting products or content) might use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering models.

* **Planning & Optimization Algorithms:** In scenarios like logistics or scheduling, agents can employ optimization algorithms or models designed to solve problems like resource allocation.
