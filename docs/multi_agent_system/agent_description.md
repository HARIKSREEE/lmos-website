# Agent Description Format

A standardized format is essential for describing the capabilities and metadata of intelligent agents. This specification should offer an appropriate level of abstraction to ensure interoperability across a wide range of agent platforms and domains.

Agent metadata is essential for several reasons:
* **Discovery:** It allows agents to find each other based on capabilities, making it easier to assemble multi-agent systems for complex tasks.
* **Interoperability:** By specifying input/output formats and API endpoints, metadata ensures that agents can communicate effectively.
* **Resource Management:** Information about an agent's resource requirements helps in efficient allocation and deployment.
* **Version Control:** Version information aids in managing updates and ensuring compatibility between different agent versions.
* **Security:** Metadata about authentication and encryption capabilities helps maintain a secure multi-agent environment.
* **Autonomy:** With comprehensive metadata, agents can make informed decisions about which other agents to interact with, enhancing the system's autonomy.
