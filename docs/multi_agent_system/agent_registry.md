# Agent Registry

A centralized Agent Registry is necessary, serving as a repository where agents can register themselves and query information about other registered agents. This would facilitate easy discovery and integration across networks.

An Agent registry is essential for several reasons:
* **Discovery and Integration:** The registry serves as a centralized repository where agents can register themselves and query information about other registered agents. This facilitates easy discovery and integration of agents across different networks and systems.
* **Metadata Management:** The registry stores and manages agent metadata, including capabilities, API endpoints, and resource requirements. This allows other agents to find and utilize specific functionalities offered by registered agents.
* **Dynamic Updates:** As agents' capabilities or status change, they can update their metadata in the registry. This ensures that the latest information about each agent is always available to the rest of the system.
* **Cross-Network Communication:** The registry enables agents to discover and interact with other agents across different networks or domains, facilitating broader collaboration and interoperability.
* **Version Control:** The registry can store version information for each agent, helping to manage updates and ensure compatibility between different agent versions.
* **Security Management:** A centralized registry can implement and enforce security policies, ensuring that only authorized agents can discover certain agents.
